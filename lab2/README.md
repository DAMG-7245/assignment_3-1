## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to use **Snowflake Notebooks** for data engineering tasks, including data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration. The lab covers the following:

- Setting up Snowflake Notebooks
- Loading data into Snowflake
- Transforming data using SQL and Python
- Automating workflows with Tasks
- Visualizing data within the notebook

## Steps Completed
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configured Snowflake Notebook environment
   - Created required databases, schemas, and warehouses
